Praying mantis insects, tiny snakes, and toads are examples of other animal species that consume grasshoppers.

        <p>
            Large numbers of grasshoppers can be consumed by chickens, and birds wandering your garden can almost completely control grasshoppers and other insects. This purpose is also served by other domestic birds, such as ducks and geese.

        Use pesticides like spinosad, neem, or pyrethrum for serious infestations.Plants that are severely infested should be sealed in plastic bags. The plants and dead bugs can be composted after one week.        </p>`
